        <h1>Why Doctor Teleconsultation Industry is Booming</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <div class="section">
            <p>In recent years, the doctor teleconsultation industry has witnessed a massive transformation. What once seemed like a futuristic idea is now a mainstream healthcare service, making doctor visits possible with just a few clicks.</p>
            <p>The rise of teleconsultations is driven by technology, convenience, and necessity. According to a McKinsey report, telehealth usage surged 38 times from pre-pandemic levels in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic played a huge role in giving a boost to its adoption.</p>
            <p>According to a report, the teleconsultation industry will grow by 25% by 2030.</p>

            <h2>Reasons Why The Teleconsultation Industry is Growing</h2>
            
            <div class="platform">
                <h3>Convenience & Accessibility</h3>
                <p>No more waiting rooms or long travel times. Patients can consult doctors from anywhere, anytime, 24/7. This is especially beneficial for elderly patients, people with mobility challenges, and those living in remote areas.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="platform">
                <h3>Tech-Powered Healthcare</h3>
                <p>AI-driven diagnostics, smart wearable devices, and mobile health apps are making virtual consultations more effective. Tools like real-time health monitoring and electronic prescriptions are bridging the gap between online and offline care.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="platform">
                <h3>Cost Savings</h3>
                <p>Teleconsultation reduces expenses for both patients and healthcare providers. A study by Harvard Medical School found that an in-person visit costs an average of $146, whereas a telehealth visit costs around $79, almost half the price!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="platform">
                <h3>Better Healthcare Access in Rural Areas</h3>
                <p>Over 45% of the world's population lacks access to essential healthcare services. Telemedicine is helping bridge this gap by connecting patients with doctors across borders.</p>
